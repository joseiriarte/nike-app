Nike store app made with React, based on JavaScript Mastery's Tailwind CSS Course.

I've made some changes and improvements compared to the original project:
Responsive navigation menu, with a working hamburger menu and hover animations.
Hover animations for buttons and products.
Product details section with useState and conditional rendering based on which product you click on.
